Project: Online Hospital Appointment Booking System
This project simplifies the process of appointment scheduling by offering an online booking system for patients. It streamlines the workflow for healthcare providers and enhances their operational efficiency. The system allows patients to view doctor availability and book appointments at their convenience, reducing the need for manual scheduling.
